<h3> What kind of college are you looking for? </h3>
<h4> Are you looking for a 2 or 4 year college/university?  At a two-year college/university, students can earn an associate degree while at a four-year college/university, students can earn a bachelor's degree </h4>

<h4> Are you looking at whether a college/university is public or private?  Many students exclude private colleges due to their expensive costs, but with 
financial aid the cost can be reduced to the cost of a public college/university. </h4>

<h3> Is location a problem for you? </h3>
<h4> For some students location may have a big impact on which college they’ll choose. Some students aren’t willing to leave too far away from home, meanwhile others are willing to go far away. A good amount of students like to go home on weekends while others will go home during their vacation. </h4>

<h4> If you are looking forward to go away from home, are you thinking of getting a dorm or look for an apartment out of campus? Do you want a greek life in college? Are you looking for a Rural, Suburban or Urban Environment? </h4>

<h3> What are you looking forward in the learning Environment? </h3>
<h4> Do you care about the amount of people on campus? Do you care about the number of students in a class? Some people like an academic challenging environment while others like an academically comfortable environment. Are you looking forward to seeing a variety of different  type of people? </h4>

<h3> Does the college/university you are looking at have the activities you like? </h3>
<h4> Whatever college you choose to spend the next 2-4 years of life, make sure it has the activities you are interested in. Don’t forget to check out the wide variety of clubs the college has. It could be from your favorite sport to that hobby of yours that you only do at home. </h4>

<h4> Does the college/university have the major you like? This is the most important part of choosing your college/university. Are you interested in extended class availability? </h4>

<h3> Is tuition a restriction for you? </h3>
<h4> Do you have a preference in tuition? Is there a percentage of Financial Aid that you need? Are there any Work-Study programs offered? Does the college/university have a college application waiver fee. Are you planning to go to an international college? If so does your college/university offer international financial aid ? </h4>

						<h1>What are SAT and ACT Test Scores?</h1>
<h3>College admission tests, like the SAT and ACT, are standardized tests typically taken in your junior or senior year. Colleges use scores from these tests to help them make admission decisions. Each college has its own admission processes. Here are the facts you need to know. .</h3>
<h3>1. Majority Four-Year Colleges Use Test Scores in Their Admission Decisions</h3>
<h4>Colleges use SAT and ACT scores to compare the strengths and readiness of students from different high schools. Keep in mind that scores are just one part of your college application, along with grades, course rigour and recommendations.
</h4>
<h3>2. Test Scores Are Not the Most Important in Your Application </h3>
<h4>When considering the test scores for admission, different colleges consider the scores differently. Remember that colleges give more importance to your grades and the rigour of your classes not scores.
</h4>
<h3>3. Most Colleges Publish Student Test-Score Information</h3>
<h4>If you’re interested in a particular college, you can see how your scores compare. Keep in mind that colleges admit students with a wide range of the published scores; there are always some students who score above, or even below. Think of these scores as a guide, not a cut-off. Here is a really good resource compare your scores: 
<a href=" http://www.collegesimply.com/guides/colleges-by-test-score/">College Simple</a>
</h4>
<h3>4. Admission Tests Let Colleges Find You</h3>
<h4>Once you sign up for the SAT, you get an opportunity to hear from colleges that have an interest in you based on a combination of your test scores, grades, academic interests, and other characteristics.
</h4>
<h3>5. Colleges May Use Scores to Award Scholarships
</h3>
<h4>Most scholarship money comes from colleges. Some colleges use your test scores, alone or in combination with other characteristics and achievements, to award their funds. Some colleges may even automatically award you a scholarship if you earn a certain score. 

</h4>
<h3>6. Scores May Use Scores to Determine Placement in College Classes
</h3>
<h4>So some colleges use scores to place students in classes that are at the right level for them. Scores can also be used to identify students who may benefit from specific advisor or academic support in college.
</h4>
<h1></h1>
<h3>7. Most Four-Year Colleges Require Scores, and  Two-Year Colleges Recommend Them
</h3>
<h4>Nearly all four-year colleges require you to submit admission test scores — you are not allowed to apply without them. There is some exceptions like open-admission colleges, including community colleges, don’t require scores but sometimes may use them to give you scholarship and for placement.
</h4>
<h3>8.Who can see your scores?
</h3>
<h4>You are the only one who chooses who can see your scores, because you’re in charge of sending them. If you decide to retake the SAT, you can often pick to send only your best scores. But each college establishes its own policy for how it uses multiple scores

						At this point you should have decided on the colleges you want to attend. 
Now the interesting part is actually applying to said institutions. First, let’s talk about the application process.
Colleges can use three different application models: the Common Application, the Universal College Application, and/or their own personal application. You 
can only choose one to submit to a college, but keep in mind that all are treated equally. Regardless of the model, colleges require basic elements from an 
applicant: GPA, course difficulty, extracurriculars, and an essay. You can use any of these models to apply Early Decision, Early Action, 
Early Action-Restricted, or Regular Decision, which are the deadline plans for college admission. Once you receive your decision, you have to make your own. 
If you were accepted, then you have until May 1st to make your deposit. If you were rejected, then you move on to the next school. If you were waitlisted 
or deferred, then you can wait for the college’s final decision along with other school’s decisions.
	
	</h3>
	
	<h2>Decision Plans</h2>
	<h2><ol>Early Decision</ol></h2>
		<h3>
		<p>
		Early Decision is a plan that allows a student to apply to a school in the first semester and get a decision back by November 1st.
		The only drawback is that this decision is binding, the student has to go to this school. Therefore, it is recommended that the student only apply 
		Early Decision to a school if they are certain they want to attend that school. 
						</p>
	<h2><ol>Early Action and Early Action-Restricted</ol></h2>
		<h3>
		<p>
		Early Action allows students to apply to schools early like in Early Decision except this plan isn't binding, which means student s can apply to as many Early Action 
		plans as they please. Early Action-Restricted, however, limits students to applying to one school until they receive a decision from that school. Thus,
		it has the application limitations of Early Decision with the freedom of Early Action.
						</p>
	<h2><ol>Regular Decision</ol></h2>
		<h3>
		<p>
		Regular Decision is the route that most students take. Students can apply to as many schools as they want in January and receive a non-binding decision
		by March, at the latest.

						<h2>Financial aid is money distributed based on a student's financial need and merit (academic, athletic, etc.).
Aid is given to students by the government, colleges, private organizations, or the state in the form of loans, grants, scholarships, and work study
programs. The best way to receive these types of aid is through the FAFSA or CSS PROFILE forms.</h2> 
	<h2>Based on the guidelines of these forms, a lot of families believe that they don't qualify for aid. Although, approximately 66% of families
qualify for some aid. Thus, it is always in your favor to </h2>
<h2>Types of Financial Aid</h2>	
		<h2><ol>Grants and Scholarship</ol></h2>
			<h3>
			<p>Grants and scholarships are similar in that they are "free money",they don't have to be paid back, awarded by the government, banks
			or other federal institutions.
			Also, it is possible to lose both types of aid due to criminal activity, no longer meeting the requirements, and other factors.
			The difference lies in the purpose of the two: grants are mostly awarded based on financial need whereas scholarships are based on merit.
			</p>
			</h3>
		<h2><ol>Loans</ol></h2>
			<h3>
			<p>A student can get a loan from the government. Unlike grants and scholarships, loans have to be paid back with interest, which means students 
			have to pay back more than what they withdrew.
			Students take use loans more than any other form of financial aid, which tends to leave them in a lot of debt.
			</p>
			</h3>
		<h2><ol>Work Study</ol></h2>
			<h3>
			<p>The work study program gives students the opportunity to earn money by doing jobs provided by the college. The program is essentially 
			allowing the student to pay off their financial aid. This form of financial aid doesn't cost the student anything but their time.
			With that in mind, students still have ample time to live their regular lives as it is rare to have a full-time job.
